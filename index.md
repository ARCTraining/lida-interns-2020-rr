# Reproducible research 

In this lesson we will discuss different methods and tools for better
reproducibility in research. We will demonstrate how version control, workflow
engines and containers can be used to develop reproducible workflows.

This demonstration will use Python snippets but all tools work equally well for
other programming languages.


## Prerequisites

1. You need to install [Git, Python, Make, Snakemake](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).

2. [Docker]((https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/)) is optional.
