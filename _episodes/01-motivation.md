## Food for thought

- A couple of researchers get great results and submit to a high-profile journal.
- Reviewers ask for new figures and alternative analysis.
- The researchers start working on revisions and generate modified figures, but find inconsistencies with old figures.
- The researchers can't find some of the data they used to generate the original results, and 
  can't figure out which parameters they used when running their analyses.
- The manuscript is still languishing in the drawer...

## What is reproducible research?

> “reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator. That is, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis in an attempt to yield the same results. Reproducibility is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be believable and informative.” 
>
> -- <cite> U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) subcommittee on replicability in science</cite>

- For any research project, an independent researcher should be able to replicate an experiment under the same conditions and obtain the same results
  - the same results should be obtained under the same contitions
  - it should be possible to recreate the same conditions!
- "Experiment" is interpreted in a wide sense, encompassing also computational work

## Why all the talk about reproducible research?
   - A recent [survey](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970) in Nature revealed that irreproducible experiments are a problem across all domains of science.

## Factors behind irreproducible research 

- Not enough documentation on how experiment is conducted and data is generated 
- Data used to generate original results unavailable
- Software used to generate original results unavailable
- Difficult to recreate software environment (libraries, versions) used to generate original results
   
 
## Levels of reproducibility

Ensuring that one's research is fully reproducible can be a challenging task, 
but multiple tools exist to make it easier.
