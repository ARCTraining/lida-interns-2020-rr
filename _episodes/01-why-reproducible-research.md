## Food for thought

Mark and tom are researchers at a university. They got some great results, which they submitted to a high-profile journal. The reviews were quite positive, but reviewers asked for some new figures, alternative analysis and a change to existing figures.
Mark and tom started to work on revisions, but the problem is that when they tried to generate modified figures; the figures don't match. The new figures are quite different from what they have found and don't show the observation they had found. Tom usually keeps track of which code has generated which figures, but he was in a rush to submit the paper by deadline. He forgot to keep track of the files as usual.
Tom has left university for a job in industry and ever since the manuscript is languishing in the drawer.

In many cases, we have to start from existing work.

## Why reproducible research?
   - long term value of data
   - Uniqueness of data, i.e., data collected today may be invalid/inappropriate 6 months
     from now
   - Publications after 2 years data collection ends
   - We want to repeat the same experiment with different data and settings, few months later

## Why all the talk about reproducible research
   - A recent [survey](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970) in Nature revealed that irreproducible experiments are a problem across all domains of science.

   - Another online [survey](http://www.ascb.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/final-survey-results-without-Q11.pdf) of nearly 900 members of the American Society for Cell Biology reveals that most of the research was irreproducible.
