## Containers

- Containers can be built to bundle *all the necessary ingredients* (data, code, environment).
- A container provides operating-system-level virtualization, sharing the host systemâ€™s kernel with other containers.
- Popular container implementations are [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/).


### Docker

- Available for most common operating systems.
- A mechanism to "send the computer to the data" when data is too
  large or too sensitive to travel over network.
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a platform to share Docker images (stored in repositories - similar to a Git repository).
- Public Docker images available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).

  <h4 class="alert-heading">Use only official and trusted images!</h4>
  <p>
    Not all images can be trusted! There have been examples of contaminated
    images so investigate before using images blindly. Apply same caution as installing
    software packages from untrusted package repositories.

### Singularity

- [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/) is aimed at scientific community and to run scientific workflows on HPC resources.
- Docker images can be converted into Singularity images.

### Pros and cons of containers

Containers are popular for a reason - they solve a number of
important problems:
- Allow for seamlessly moving workflows across different platforms.
- Much more lightweight than virtual machines.
- Eliminates the "works on my machine" situation.
- For software with many dependencies with it turn own dependencies possibly the only (?) way
  to preserve the computational experiment for future reproducibility.

However, containers may also have some drawbacks:
- Containers can have security vulnerabilities which can be exploited.
- Can be used to hide away software installation problems and thereby
  discourage good software development practices.
- It may not be clear whether to record the environment as image or as recipe (Dockerfile).
